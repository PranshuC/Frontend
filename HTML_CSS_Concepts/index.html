<!-- DOCTYPE for HTML5 is shorter, HTML4's used to be longer -->
<!-- html tag isn't necessary, but everything comes within it
HTML is never going to give any error, you can skip any tag
you could use any tag to do anything else from what it is created for.

You should use semantically correct HTML
1) SEO purpose
2) Developer efficiency
3) Accessibility

End user shouldn't see anything within <head>
<title> will be shown in browser tab, bookmarks, history, search engine results
<link> is used for some external link.
href is the URL for linked resource & ref is text for what the link refers
<link> : self closing tag

href, rel -> attributes of a HTML tag :
1) Those that are used by html
2) Those which are custom defined and used by the developers

<body> is have everything what an end user will see.
<header>, <footer>, <main>, <aside>, <article>, <section>, <nav>
Earlier, <div> was used & abused extensively for website building,
but these are semantically corrects tags used for better development

navbar could/not be part of the header (child, if yes)
footer - add important sitemap links : resources, contacts, social media
internal linking for end user to continue the flow of navigation
<main> is central content part other than header & footer
Like newspaper, each section(sports/tech/entertainment) can have articles 
<section> -> <article> -> <p>
<aside> is used for ads - not in flow of page : right/left panels

Login page will be in HTML for SEO optimised
